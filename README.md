Matlab code that does the QA calculations.

Code changes are encouraged.

Input files are not in this repository. (Unclassified GMF)
Input files are sent out via Kiteworks.

Step 1:
Put all the files (including the contour csv and gmf excel) into a folder.

Step 2:
Open up "START_HERE_initialize_QA_calculations_rev1.m" in Matlab.

Step 3: Press F5 or Run that file.

Note: The first time it runs the analysis, it may take a few minutes.
Re-runs are quickier, since it saves the last calculations.
